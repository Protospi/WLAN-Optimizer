## Abstract

This work presents a design algorithm solution to an applied toy problem using _Optimization_ and _Decision Theory_. The objective was to find the best position, amount and overload of internet __Access Points__ to cover internet demand in a conference based on the position of the participants. Simplifications like ignoring the movement of the clients and the interference of the wi-fi signals from different routers were adopted. The algorithm was designed from scratch without any library in order to illustrate a thinking process on tackling this kind of problem. Just __tidyverse__ libraries such as __readr__, __dplyr__, __plotly__ and __ggplot2__ were used to wrangle data and draw graphics, __Rcpp__ to improve performance with C++ and __shiny__ to build an interactive application. An article on PDF format explaining each step of the project in details, an _Rpubs_ slides to illustrate graphically the animated algorithm working and a Shiny application on _Shiny.io_ to put the algorithm into production were baked in RStudio connected to this _Git_ repository.
